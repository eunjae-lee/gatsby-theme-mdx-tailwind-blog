These days I've been trying and enjoying [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It provides many starters and this page is created by [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

Using it, to create a new blog post, I need to create a file such as `./content/blog/hello-world/index.md` and its content would be

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
date: '2015-05-01T22:12:03.284Z'
---

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!
```

This sounds simple enough, but I wanted to make it simpler with [hygen](http://www.hygen.io/)

Here are the steps.

```bash
npx hygen init self
npx hygen generator new --name blog
```

`_templates/blog/new/hello.ejs.t` will be added. The name doesn't matter, so let's change:

```bash
mv _templates/blog/new/hello.ejs.t _templates/blog/new/index.ejs.t
```

Edit `index.ejs.t` like the following:

```ejs
---
to: content/blog/test-post/index.md
---
This is a test post.
```

Let's try run:

```bash
npx hygen blog new
```

It will generate a file at `content/blog/test-post/index.md` and its content will be `This is a test post.`. Now you'll see how it works.

Let's add a prompt so that it will ask you the title of a new post and you will also slugify it for url.

Add `_templates/blog/new/index.js` like the following:

```js
const slugify = require('slugify')

module.exports = {
  prompt: ({ prompter }) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      prompter
        .prompt({
          type: 'input',
          name: 'title',
          message: 'What is the title?',
        })
        .then(({ title }) => {
          resolve({
            title,
            date: new Date().toISOString(),
            slug: slugify(title, { remove: /[*+~.()'"!:@]/g, lower: true }),
          })
        })
    })
  },
}
```

Edit `_templates/blog/new/index.ejs.t` like the following:

```ejs
---
to: content/blog/<%= slug %>/index.md
---
---
title: '<%= title %>'
date: '<%= date %>'
---
```

Okay, let's add `slugify` to your devDependencies:

```bash
yarn add slugify -D
```

And run it:

```bash
npx hygen blog new
```

It will ask you the title:

```
? What is the title? › The First Blog Post
```

It will generate `content/blog/the-first-blog-post/index.md` and its content will be:

```md
---
title: 'The First Blog Post'
date: '2019-01-01T08:50:08.194Z'
---
```

Okay, let's put a script into `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "g": "hygen blog new",
}
```

And add `hygen` to devDependencies:

```bash
yarn add hygen -D
```

Okay, you're good to go.

```bash
yarn g
```
